<div>When the time comes for your departure, please be aware of certain general guidelines:</div>
<ol>

<% if @matches.size > 1 %>
<li>You will only be contacted by the van driver if you are the group leader (the individual whose name the booking was made under). If you otherwise wish to know the status of your shuttle, you can call or go to <%= link_to "SuperShuttle's Tracking Service", "https://reservations.supershuttle.com/Default.aspx?content=WhereIsMyVan&lng", :html => {:target => "_blank"} %> and enter your SuperShuttle Confirmation number.</li>
<li>It is the group leaderâ€™s responsibility to contact you with the information he/she has received from the driver. However, it is each of your responsibility to make sure all members of your party are accounted for and on the van. Please use the group information provided here to do so.</li>

<p><b>For the Group Leader:</b> You have been chosen as the group leader for this ride. Your SuperShuttle driver will only call you when he/she is on his way, and you will be notified if said driver is running late. It is your responsibility to pass on this information to the other members of your group, and ensure that everyone is on board.</p>
<% end %>

<p>If you encounter any last minute problems, please send a text message alert to RideGrouped's emergency number at <%= "(516) 808-9183" %> and email RideGrouped Customer Service at <%= "service@ridegrouped.com" %>.</p>

<p>RideGrouped is not responsible for late SuperShuttles or missed flights.
