<li>Upon entering the van, please confirm your destination with your driver and inform him/her of relevant information regarding your flight (Terminal Number and Airline, etc).</li>
<li>This reservation entitles you to bring two bags for check in and one carry on item using the SuperShuttle service. Please make sure each item is under 50 pounds.

<p><b>For the Group Leader:</b> You have been chosen as the group leader for this ride. Your SuperShuttle will only call you when he/she is on his way, and you will be notified if said driver is running late. It is your responsibility to pass on this information to the other members of your group (their emails and phone numbers are attached here), and ensure that everyone is on board.</p>


<p>Thanks,<br>
The RideGrouped Team</p>
